    abstract = {The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnets depends on subtle spin-orbit-induced effects in the electronic structure, and recent ab initio studies found that it was necessary to sample the Brillouin zone at millions of k-points to converge the calculation. We present an efficient first-principles approach for computing this quantity. We start out by performing a conventional electronic-structure calculation including spin-orbit coupling on a uniform and relatively coarse k-point mesh. From the resulting Bloch states, maximally localized Wannier functions are constructed which reproduce the ab initio states up to the Fermi level. The Hamiltonian and position-operator matrix elements, needed to represent the energy bands and Berry curvatures, are then set up between the Wannier orbitals. This completes the first stage of the calculation, whereby the low-energy ab initio problem is transformed into an effective tight-binding form. The second stage only involves Fourier transforms and unitary transformations of the small matrices setup in the first stage. With these inexpensive operations, the quantities of interest are interpolated onto a dense k-point mesh and used to evaluate the anomalous Hall conductivity as a Brillouin zone integral. The present scheme, which also avoids the cumbersome summation over all unoccupied states in the Kubo formula, is applied to bcc Fe, giving excellent agreement with conventional, less efficient first-principles calculations. Remarkably, we find that about 99\% of the effect can be recovered by keeping a set of terms depending only on the Hamiltonian matrix elements, not on matrix elements of the position operator.},

    abstract = {The zero-frequency limit of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ(2)ijk is calculated within the framework of energy-band theory. Both vector and scalar potential representations of the electric field are investigated. The apparent divergences of standard finite-frequency expressions in the limit of zero frequency are shown to vanish. The two- and three-band contributions in the scalar potential representation, describing the electric field effect on the coherent (phase factor) and cell-periodic parts of the Bloch function, respectively, are shown to combine as required by gauge invariance to yield the result obtained in the vector potential representation, where only three-band terms contribute. In crystals of zinc-blende symmetry, virtual electronic processes involving one valence and two conduction bands, originating from the Γ15 valence and Γ1 and Γ15 conduction states at →k=0, dominate virtual-hole processes involving one conduction and two valence bands. The sign of χ(2)123 is related to the Brillouin-zone average of the ordering with respect to energy of the lowest conduction bands. The magnitude of χ(2)123 is related to the average over the Brillouin zone of the inverse fifth power of the local energy separation Ecv(→k) between the valence and lowest conduction bands, in contrast to the inverse third power average of the same quantity known for the linear susceptibility χ(1). This enhance the contribution to χ(2)123 from smallgap regions of the band structure in a manner similar to that also found for χ(3). The value of χ(2)123 calculated for zinc-blende crystals in both the constant energy gap and the parabolic criticalpoint models is consistently lower than that observed experimentally. Extended calculations using more realistic analytic approximations to the local energy-band structure suggest that this discrepancy is due in part to band nonparabolicity effects with additional contributions from enhancement of oscillator strength from the electron-hole Coulomb interaction.},

Additionally, we analyze the relationship between response and material properties in detail. Photocurrent does not depend simply or strongly on the magnitude of material polarization, as has been previously assumed; instead, electronic states with delocalized, covalent bonding that is highly asymmetric along the current direction are required for strong shift current enhancements. The complexity of the response dependence on both external and material parameters suggests applications not only in solar energy conversion, but in photocatalysis and sensor and switch type devices as well.},

    abstract = {Although Weyl fermions have proven elusive in high-energy physics, their existence as emergent quasiparticles has been predicted in certain crystalline solids in which either inversion or time-reversal symmetry is broken. Recently they have been observed in transition metal monopnictides (TMMPs) such as TaAs, a class of noncentrosymmetric materials that heretofore received only limited attention. The question that arises now is whether these materials will exhibit novel, enhanced, or technologically applicable electronic properties. The TMMPs are polar metals, a rare subset of inversion-breaking crystals that would allow spontaneous polarization, were it not screened by conduction electrons. Despite the absence of spontaneous polarization, polar metals can exhibit other signatures of inversion-symmetry breaking, most notably second-order nonlinear optical polarizability, χ(2), leading to phenomena such as optical rectification and second-harmonic generation (SHG). Here we report measurements of SHG that reveal a giant, anisotropic χ(2) in the TMMPs TaAs, TaP and NbAs. With the fundamental and second-harmonic fields oriented parallel to the polar axis, the value of χ(2) is larger by almost one order of magnitude than its value in the archetypal electro-optic materials GaAs and ZnTe, and in fact larger than reported in any crystal to date.},

    abstract = {We use a first-principles density functional theory approach to calculate the shift current of uniformly illuminated single-layer Ge and Sn monochalcogenides. We find a larger effective three-dimensional shift current (\${\textbackslash}sim 200\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$A/V\${\textasciicircum}2\$) than has been previously observed in common polar systems. The integral of the shift-current tensor along the polarization axis, a physically relevant quantity in applications, is correlated to the large spontaneous effective three-dimensional electric polarization (\${\textbackslash}sim 1.9\$ C/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$), and is well described by the one-dimensional Rice-Mele tight-binding model. Using our model, we discuss the conditions under which the response is optimized as a function of the system polarization. Importantly, our calculations indicate that the shift current will be largest in the visible spectrum, suggesting these materials may be promising for polar optoelectronic devices.},

This method is incorrect as it violates specific sum rules. We give a consistent implementation that respects the sum rules: ranm(k) and ranm;b(k), when written in terms of momentum matrix elements and energy eigenvalues, should be evaluated within Kohn–Sham LDA and not with the scissored one. Calculated spectra via full potential augmented plane wave plus local orbital band structures for the second-harmonic generation tensor χxyz2(−2ω;ω,ω) show that the errors in previous calculations are approximately 39\% and 28\% for GaAs and GaP, respectively.},

Based on the identification of a polarization operator P that would be valid even in a more complicated many-body treatment, the approach avoids apparent, unphysical divergences of the nonlinear optical response at zero frequency that sometimes plague such calculations. As a result, it allows for a careful examination of actual divergences associated with physical phenomena that have been studied before, but not in the context of nonlinear optics. These are (i) a coherent current control effect called “injection current,” or “circular photocurrent,” and (ii) photocurrent due to the shift of the center of electron charge in noncentrosymmetric materials in the process of optical excitation, called “shift current.” The expressions we present are amenable for numerical calculations, and we demonstrate this by performing a full band-structure calculation of the shift current coefficient for GaAs.},

The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid of k points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of maximally localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus setting up an “exact tight-binding model.” In this compact representation the k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized Slater-Koster interpolation. Owing to the strong localization of the Wannier orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be performed with ab initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation, band gradients, effective masses, and other k derivatives needed for transport and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.},

    abstract = {This paper forms a natural extension of previous work of the authors published in 1963. An alternative formula to that previously obtained is derived for the r th-order conductivity tensor σ μα 1 ...α r ( r ) (ω 1 ,..., ω r ) of a solid by calculating the time development operator of the charged particles in the solid. This leads to a general explicit expression for σ ( r ) in terms of the energy eigenstates of the solid, which provides a generalization to arbitrary order of the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula given essentially by σ (1) . This alternative formula can also be cast into a form which reveals the so-called overall permutation symmetry property of the tensors. This says that the related susceptibility tensor χ μα 1 ...α r ( r ) (ω 1 ,..., ω r ) = i σ μα 1 ...α r ( r ) (ω 1 ,..., ω r )/(ω 1 + ω 2 +... + ω r ) is invariant under all ( r + 1)! permutations of the pairs μ(- ω 1 - ω 2 -... - ω r ), α 1 ω 1 , α 2 ω 2 ,..., α r ω r for frequencies lying in any part of the complex frequency plane. The significance of this symmetry relation is discussed for various special cases. In particular, it is valid at real frequencies when all singularities of the tensor are avoided so that no energy transfer can take place between the solid and the radiation field. It is then shown, among other things, to allow a derivation of the Manley-Rowe relations for a dispersive medium. The consequences of the invariance of the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the solid under time reversal are discussed. It is shown that the r th-order conductivity tensor changes sign when all frequencies are negated.},

Electric polarization has a quantized gauge ambiguity and is normally observed at surfaces via the surface charge density, while shift current is a bulk property and is described by shift vector gauge-invariant at each point in momentum space. They are connected because the same optical transitions that are described in shift currents pick out a relative gauge between valence and conduction bands. We discuss subtleties arising when there are points at the Brillouin zone where optical transitions are absent. We conclude that two dimensional materials with significant interband polarization differences must have high bulk photocurrent, meaning that the modern theory of polarization can be used as an efficiently calculable means to search for bulk photovoltaic material candidates.},

    abstract = {There are a variety of nonlinear optical effects including higher harmonic generations, photovoltaic effects, and nonlinear Kerr rotations. They are realized by strong light irradiation to materials that results in nonlinear polarizations in the electric field. These are of great importance in studying the physics of excited states of the system as well as for applications to optical devices and solar cells. Nonlinear properties of materials are usually described by nonlinear susceptibilities, which have complex expressions including many matrix elements and energy denominators. On the other hand, a nonequilibrium steady state under an electric field periodic in time has a concise description in terms of the Floquet bands of electrons dressed by photons. We show theoretically, using the Floquet formalism, that various nonlinear optical effects, such as the shift current in noncentrosymmetric materials, photovoltaic Hall response, and photo-induced change of order parameters under the continuous irradiation of monochromatic light, can be described in a unified fashion by topological quantities involving the Berry connection and Berry curvature. We found that vector fields defined with the Berry connections in the space of momentum and/or parameters govern the nonlinear responses. This topological view offers a route to designing nonlinear optical materials.

To rationalize this result we model the optical response with a simple one-dimensional two-band model along the spontaneous polarization direction.

The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or "Boys orbitals" as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid of k points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of maximally localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus setting up an “exact tight-binding model.” In this compact representation the k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized Slater-Koster interpolation. Owing to the strong localization of the Wannier orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be performed with ab initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation, band gradients, effective masses, and other k derivatives needed for transport and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.},

First-principles prediction of NLO responses is of great importance to fundamental research and device design, but efficient computational methods are still lacking. The main challenge is that the calculations require a very dense k-point sampling that is computationally expensive and a proper treatment of the gauge problem for topological quantities. Here we present a Wannier interpolation method for first-principles calculation of NLO responses, which overcomes the challenge. This method interpolates physical quantities accurately for any desired k point with little computational cost and constructs a smooth gauge by the perturbation theory. To demonstrate the method, we study shift current of monolayer GeS and WS2 as well as SHG of bulk GaAs, getting good agreements with previous results. We show that the traditional sum rule method converges slowly with the number of bands, whereas the perturbation way does not. Moreover, our method is easily adapted to build tight-binding models for the following theoretical investigations. Last but not least, the method is compatible with most first-principles approaches, including density functional theory and beyond. With these advantages, Wannier interpolation is a promising method for first-principles studies of NLO phenomena.},

We present an efficient first-principles approach for computing this quantity. We start out by performing a conventional electronic-structure calculation including spin-orbit coupling on a uniform and relatively coarse k-point mesh. From the resulting Bloch states, maximally localized Wannier functions are constructed which reproduce the ab initio states up to the Fermi level. The Hamiltonian and position-operator matrix elements, needed to represent the energy bands and Berry curvatures, are then set up between the Wannier orbitals. This completes the first stage of the calculation, whereby the low-energy ab initio problem is transformed into an effective tight-binding form. The second stage only involves Fourier transforms and unitary transformations of the small matrices setup in the first stage. With these inexpensive operations, the quantities of interest are interpolated onto a dense k-point mesh and used to evaluate the anomalous Hall conductivity as a Brillouin zone integral. The present scheme, which also avoids the cumbersome summation over all unoccupied states in the Kubo formula, is applied to bcc Fe, giving excellent agreement with conventional, less efficient first-principles calculations. Remarkably, we find that about 99\% of the effect can be recovered by keeping a set of terms depending only on the Hamiltonian matrix elements, not on matrix elements of the position operator.},

    abstract = {wannier90  is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90  is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90  is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90  2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90  is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Nature of problem:
Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions [2] from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled, and using these Wannier functions to calculate electronic properties of materials.
Solution method:
In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required [3, 4].
Reasons for new version:

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

Our theory also reveals that the bulk photovoltaic effect can occur even in pure nonpyroelectric piezoelectric crystals, e.g., Te and GaP, which have no polar axis and therefore no a priori direction for the photovoltaic current.},

The first principles results for BaTiO3 reproduce experimental photocurrent direction and magnitude as a function of light frequency, as well as the dependence of current on light polarization, demonstrating that shift current is the dominant mechanism of the bulk photovoltaic effect in BaTiO3. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between response and material properties in detail. Photocurrent does not depend simply or strongly on the magnitude of material polarization, as has been previously assumed; instead, electronic states with delocalized, covalent bonding that is highly asymmetric along the current direction are required for strong shift current enhancements. The complexity of the response dependence on both external and material parameters suggests applications not only in solar energy conversion, but in photocatalysis and sensor and switch type devices as well.},

Based on the identification of a polarization operator P that would be valid even in a more complicated many-body treatment, the approach avoids apparent, unphysical divergences of the nonlinear optical response at zero frequency that sometimes plague such calculations. As a result, it allows for a careful examination of actual divergences associated with physical phenomena that have been studied before, but not in the context of nonlinear optics. These are (i) a coherent current control effect called “injection current,” or “circular photocurrent,” and (ii) photocurrent due to the shift of the center of electron charge in noncentrosymmetric materials in the process of optical excitation, called “shift current.” The expressions we present are amenable for numerical calculations, and we demonstrate this by performing a full band-structure calculation of the shift current coefficient for GaAs.},

    abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute “ab initio molecular simulations” (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree–Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

    abstract = {We present a general formula for the tight-binding representation of momentum matrix elements needed for calculating the conductivity based on the Kubo-Greenwood formula using atomic orbitals, which are in general not orthogonal to other orbitals at different sites. In particular, the position matrix element is demonstrated to be important for delivering the exact momentum matrix element. This general formula, applicable to both orthonormal and non-orthonormal bases, solely needs the information of the position matrix elements and the ingredients that have already contained in the tight-binding representation. For a benchmark calculation, we study the anomalous Hall conductivity in the standard example, ferromagnetic bcc Fe, by a first-principles tight-binding Hamiltonian. By assuming the commutation relation \${\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}vec\{p\}\} = (i m\_e/{\textbackslash}hbar) [{\textbackslash}hat\{H\},{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}vec\{r\}\}]\$, the obtained frequency-dependent Hall conductivity is found to be in good agreement with existing theoretical and experimental results. Since a tight-binding Hamiltonian can be straightforwardly obtained after finishing a first-principles calculation using atomic basis functions that are generated before the self-consistent calculation, the derived formula is particularly useful for those first-principles calculations.},
