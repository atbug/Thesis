    abstract = {The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnets depends on subtle spin-orbit-induced effects in the electronic structure, and recent ab initio studies found that it was necessary to sample the Brillouin zone at millions of k-points to converge the calculation. We present an efficient first-principles approach for computing this quantity. We start out by performing a conventional electronic-structure calculation including spin-orbit coupling on a uniform and relatively coarse k-point mesh. From the resulting Bloch states, maximally localized Wannier functions are constructed which reproduce the ab initio states up to the Fermi level. The Hamiltonian and position-operator matrix elements, needed to represent the energy bands and Berry curvatures, are then set up between the Wannier orbitals. This completes the first stage of the calculation, whereby the low-energy ab initio problem is transformed into an effective tight-binding form. The second stage only involves Fourier transforms and unitary transformations of the small matrices setup in the first stage. With these inexpensive operations, the quantities of interest are interpolated onto a dense k-point mesh and used to evaluate the anomalous Hall conductivity as a Brillouin zone integral. The present scheme, which also avoids the cumbersome summation over all unoccupied states in the Kubo formula, is applied to bcc Fe, giving excellent agreement with conventional, less efficient first-principles calculations. Remarkably, we find that about 99\% of the effect can be recovered by keeping a set of terms depending only on the Hamiltonian matrix elements, not on matrix elements of the position operator.},

    abstract = {The zero-frequency limit of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ(2)ijk is calculated within the framework of energy-band theory. Both vector and scalar potential representations of the electric field are investigated. The apparent divergences of standard finite-frequency expressions in the limit of zero frequency are shown to vanish. The two- and three-band contributions in the scalar potential representation, describing the electric field effect on the coherent (phase factor) and cell-periodic parts of the Bloch function, respectively, are shown to combine as required by gauge invariance to yield the result obtained in the vector potential representation, where only three-band terms contribute. In crystals of zinc-blende symmetry, virtual electronic processes involving one valence and two conduction bands, originating from the Γ15 valence and Γ1 and Γ15 conduction states at →k=0, dominate virtual-hole processes involving one conduction and two valence bands. The sign of χ(2)123 is related to the Brillouin-zone average of the ordering with respect to energy of the lowest conduction bands. The magnitude of χ(2)123 is related to the average over the Brillouin zone of the inverse fifth power of the local energy separation Ecv(→k) between the valence and lowest conduction bands, in contrast to the inverse third power average of the same quantity known for the linear susceptibility χ(1). This enhance the contribution to χ(2)123 from smallgap regions of the band structure in a manner similar to that also found for χ(3). The value of χ(2)123 calculated for zinc-blende crystals in both the constant energy gap and the parabolic criticalpoint models is consistently lower than that observed experimentally. Extended calculations using more realistic analytic approximations to the local energy-band structure suggest that this discrepancy is due in part to band nonparabolicity effects with additional contributions from enhancement of oscillator strength from the electron-hole Coulomb interaction.},

Additionally, we analyze the relationship between response and material properties in detail. Photocurrent does not depend simply or strongly on the magnitude of material polarization, as has been previously assumed; instead, electronic states with delocalized, covalent bonding that is highly asymmetric along the current direction are required for strong shift current enhancements. The complexity of the response dependence on both external and material parameters suggests applications not only in solar energy conversion, but in photocatalysis and sensor and switch type devices as well.},

    abstract = {Although Weyl fermions have proven elusive in high-energy physics, their existence as emergent quasiparticles has been predicted in certain crystalline solids in which either inversion or time-reversal symmetry is broken. Recently they have been observed in transition metal monopnictides (TMMPs) such as TaAs, a class of noncentrosymmetric materials that heretofore received only limited attention. The question that arises now is whether these materials will exhibit novel, enhanced, or technologically applicable electronic properties. The TMMPs are polar metals, a rare subset of inversion-breaking crystals that would allow spontaneous polarization, were it not screened by conduction electrons. Despite the absence of spontaneous polarization, polar metals can exhibit other signatures of inversion-symmetry breaking, most notably second-order nonlinear optical polarizability, χ(2), leading to phenomena such as optical rectification and second-harmonic generation (SHG). Here we report measurements of SHG that reveal a giant, anisotropic χ(2) in the TMMPs TaAs, TaP and NbAs. With the fundamental and second-harmonic fields oriented parallel to the polar axis, the value of χ(2) is larger by almost one order of magnitude than its value in the archetypal electro-optic materials GaAs and ZnTe, and in fact larger than reported in any crystal to date.},

    abstract = {We use a first-principles density functional theory approach to calculate the shift current of uniformly illuminated single-layer Ge and Sn monochalcogenides. We find a larger effective three-dimensional shift current (\${\textbackslash}sim 200\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$A/V\${\textasciicircum}2\$) than has been previously observed in common polar systems. The integral of the shift-current tensor along the polarization axis, a physically relevant quantity in applications, is correlated to the large spontaneous effective three-dimensional electric polarization (\${\textbackslash}sim 1.9\$ C/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$), and is well described by the one-dimensional Rice-Mele tight-binding model. Using our model, we discuss the conditions under which the response is optimized as a function of the system polarization. Importantly, our calculations indicate that the shift current will be largest in the visible spectrum, suggesting these materials may be promising for polar optoelectronic devices.},

This method is incorrect as it violates specific sum rules. We give a consistent implementation that respects the sum rules: ranm(k) and ranm;b(k), when written in terms of momentum matrix elements and energy eigenvalues, should be evaluated within Kohn–Sham LDA and not with the scissored one. Calculated spectra via full potential augmented plane wave plus local orbital band structures for the second-harmonic generation tensor χxyz2(−2ω;ω,ω) show that the errors in previous calculations are approximately 39\% and 28\% for GaAs and GaP, respectively.},

Based on the identification of a polarization operator P that would be valid even in a more complicated many-body treatment, the approach avoids apparent, unphysical divergences of the nonlinear optical response at zero frequency that sometimes plague such calculations. As a result, it allows for a careful examination of actual divergences associated with physical phenomena that have been studied before, but not in the context of nonlinear optics. These are (i) a coherent current control effect called “injection current,” or “circular photocurrent,” and (ii) photocurrent due to the shift of the center of electron charge in noncentrosymmetric materials in the process of optical excitation, called “shift current.” The expressions we present are amenable for numerical calculations, and we demonstrate this by performing a full band-structure calculation of the shift current coefficient for GaAs.},

The first step is to perform a conventional first-principles calculation and store the low-lying Bloch functions evaluated on a uniform grid of k points in the Brillouin zone. We then map those states onto a set of maximally localized Wannier functions, and evaluate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and the other needed operators between the Wannier orbitals, thus setting up an “exact tight-binding model.” In this compact representation the k-space quantities are evaluated inexpensively using a generalized Slater-Koster interpolation. Owing to the strong localization of the Wannier orbitals in real space, the smoothness and accuracy of the k-space interpolation increases rapidly with the number of grid points originally used to construct the Wannier functions. This allows k-space integrals to be performed with ab initio accuracy at low cost. In the Wannier representation, band gradients, effective masses, and other k derivatives needed for transport and optical coefficients can be evaluated analytically, producing numerically stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings.},

    abstract = {This paper forms a natural extension of previous work of the authors published in 1963. An alternative formula to that previously obtained is derived for the r th-order conductivity tensor σ μα 1 ...α r ( r ) (ω 1 ,..., ω r ) of a solid by calculating the time development operator of the charged particles in the solid. This leads to a general explicit expression for σ ( r ) in terms of the energy eigenstates of the solid, which provides a generalization to arbitrary order of the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula given essentially by σ (1) . This alternative formula can also be cast into a form which reveals the so-called overall permutation symmetry property of the tensors. This says that the related susceptibility tensor χ μα 1 ...α r ( r ) (ω 1 ,..., ω r ) = i σ μα 1 ...α r ( r ) (ω 1 ,..., ω r )/(ω 1 + ω 2 +... + ω r ) is invariant under all ( r + 1)! permutations of the pairs μ(- ω 1 - ω 2 -... - ω r ), α 1 ω 1 , α 2 ω 2 ,..., α r ω r for frequencies lying in any part of the complex frequency plane. The significance of this symmetry relation is discussed for various special cases. In particular, it is valid at real frequencies when all singularities of the tensor are avoided so that no energy transfer can take place between the solid and the radiation field. It is then shown, among other things, to allow a derivation of the Manley-Rowe relations for a dispersive medium. The consequences of the invariance of the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the solid under time reversal are discussed. It is shown that the r th-order conductivity tensor changes sign when all frequencies are negated.},

    abstract = {We present a first-principles scheme that allows the orbital magnetization of a magnetic crystal to be evaluated accurately and efficiently even in the presence of complex Fermi surfaces. Starting from an initial electronic-structure calculation with a coarse ab initio k-point mesh, maximally localized Wannier functions are constructed and used to interpolate the necessary k-space quantities on a fine mesh, in parallel to a previously developed formalism for the anomalous Hall conductivity [X. Wang, J. Yates, I. Souza, and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 74, 195118 (2006)]. We formulate our new approach in a manifestly gauge-invariant manner, expressing the orbital magnetization in terms of traces over matrices in Wannier space. Since only a few (e.g., of the order of 20) Wannier functions are typically needed to describe the occupied and partially occupied bands, these Wannier matrices are small, which makes the interpolation itself very efficient. The method has been used to calculate the orbital magnetization of bcc Fe, hcp Co, and fcc Ni. Unlike an approximate calculation based on integrating orbital currents inside atomic spheres, our results nicely reproduce the experimentally measured ordering of the orbital magnetization in these three materials.},

    abstract = {A relationship is derived between differences in electric polarization between bands and the "shift vector" that controls part of a material's bulk photocurrent, then demonstrated in several models. Electric polarization has a quantized gauge ambiguity and is normally observed at surfaces via the surface charge density, while shift current is a bulk property and is described by shift vector gauge-invariant at each point in momentum space. They are connected because the same optical transitions that are described in shift currents pick out a relative gauge between valence and conduction bands. We discuss subtleties arising when there are points at the Brillouin zone where optical transitions are absent. We conclude that two dimensional materials with significant interband polarization differences must have high bulk photocurrent, meaning that the modern theory of polarization can be used as an efficiently calculable means to search for bulk photovoltaic material candidates.},

They are realized by strong light irradiation to materials that results in nonlinear polarizations in the electric field. These are of great importance in studying the physics of excited states of the system as well as for applications to optical devices and solar cells. Nonlinear properties of materials are usually described by nonlinear susceptibilities, which have complex expressions including many matrix elements and energy denominators. On the other hand, a nonequilibrium steady state under an electric field periodic in time has a concise description in terms of the Floquet bands of electrons dressed by photons. We show theoretically, using the Floquet formalism, that various nonlinear optical effects, such as the shift current in noncentrosymmetric materials, photovoltaic Hall response, and photo-induced change of order parameters under the continuous irradiation of monochromatic light, can be described in a unified fashion by topological quantities involving the Berry connection and Berry curvature. We found that vector fields defined with the Berry connections in the space of momentum and/or parameters govern the nonlinear responses. This topological view offers a route to designing nonlinear optical materials.
Study of nonlinear optical responses reveals their quantum topological nature.

To rationalize this result we model the optical response with a simple one-dimensional two-band model along the spontaneous polarization direction.

The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or "Boys orbitals" as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

The method is thus suitable for use in connection with conventional electronic-structure codes. The procedure also returns the total electric polarization as well as the location of each Wannier center. Sample results for Si, GaAs, molecular C2H4, and LiCl will be presented.},

First-principles prediction of NLO responses is of great importance to fundamental research and device design, but efficient computational methods are still lacking. The main challenge is that the calculations require a very dense k-point sampling that is computationally expensive and a proper treatment of the gauge problem for topological quantities. Here we present a Wannier interpolation method for first-principles calculation of NLO responses, which overcomes the challenge. This method interpolates physical quantities accurately for any desired k point with little computational cost and constructs a smooth gauge by the perturbation theory. To demonstrate the method, we study shift current of monolayer GeS and WS2 as well as SHG of bulk GaAs, getting good agreements with previous results. We show that the traditional sum rule method converges slowly with the number of bands, whereas the perturbation way does not. Moreover, our method is easily adapted to build tight-binding models for the following theoretical investigations. Last but not least, the method is compatible with most first-principles approaches, including density functional theory and beyond. With these advantages, Wannier interpolation is a promising method for first-principles studies of NLO phenomena.},

If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed.

Additionally, we analyze the relationship between response and material properties in detail. Photocurrent does not depend simply or strongly on the magnitude of material polarization, as has been previously assumed; instead, electronic states with delocalized, covalent bonding that is highly asymmetric along the current direction are required for strong shift current enhancements. The complexity of the response dependence on both external and material parameters suggests applications not only in solar energy conversion, but in photocatalysis and sensor and switch type devices as well.},

The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute “ab initio molecular simulations” (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree–Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

In particular, the position matrix element is demonstrated to be important for delivering the exact momentum matrix element. This general formula, applicable to both orthonormal and non-orthonormal bases, solely needs the information of the position matrix elements and the ingredients that have already contained in the tight-binding representation. For a benchmark calculation, we study the anomalous Hall conductivity in the standard example, ferromagnetic bcc Fe, by a first-principles tight-binding Hamiltonian. By assuming the commutation relation \${\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}vec\{p\}\} = (i m\_e/{\textbackslash}hbar) [{\textbackslash}hat\{H\},{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}vec\{r\}\}]\$, the obtained frequency-dependent Hall conductivity is found to be in good agreement with existing theoretical and experimental results. Since a tight-binding Hamiltonian can be straightforwardly obtained after finishing a first-principles calculation using atomic basis functions that are generated before the self-consistent calculation, the derived formula is particularly useful for those first-principles calculations.},

    abstract = {The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule lies at the heart of the semiclassical theory of a Bloch electron in a magnetic field. This rule is predictive of Landau levels and de Haas–van Alphen oscillations for conventional metals, as well as for a host of topological metals which have emerged in the recent intercourse between band theory, crystalline symmetries, and topology. The essential ingredients in any quantization rule are connection formulas that match the semiclassical (WKB) wave function across regions of strong quantum fluctuations. Here, we propose (a) a multicomponent WKB wave function that describes transport within degenerate-band subspaces, and (b) the requisite connection formulas for saddle points and type-II Dirac points, where tunneling respectively occurs within the same band, and between distinct bands. (a) and (b) extend previous works by incorporating phase corrections that are subleading in powers of the field; these corrections include the geometric Berry phase, and account for the orbital magnetic moment and the Zeeman coupling. A comprehensive symmetry analysis is performed for such phase corrections occurring in closed orbits, which is applicable to solids in any (magnetic) space group. We have further formulated a graph-theoretic description of semiclassical orbits. This allows us to systematize the construction of quantization rules for a large class of closed orbits (with or without tunneling), as well as to formulate the notion of a topological invariant in semiclassical magnetotransport—as a quantity that is invariant under continuous deformations of the graph. Landau levels in the presence of tunneling are generically quasirandom, i.e., disordered on the scale of nearest-neighbor level spacings but having longer-ranged correlations; we develop a perturbative theory to determine Landau levels in such quasirandom spectra.},

In some solids and for certain field orientations, λ/π are robustly integer valued, owing to the symmetry of the extremal orbit; i.e., they are the topological invariants of magnetotransport. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis identifies solids in any (magnetic) space group for which λ is a topological invariant, as well as the symmetry-enforced degeneracy of Landau levels. The analysis is simplified by our formulation of ten (and only ten) symmetry classes for closed, Fermi-surface orbits. Case studies are discussed for graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, 3D Weyl and Dirac metals, and crystalline and Z2 topological insulators. In particular, we point out that a π phase offset in the fundamental oscillation should not be viewed as a smoking gun for a 3D Dirac metal.},

These topological phases are exemplified by the monolayers of MTe2 (M=W,Mo) if spin-orbit coupling is neglected. We characterize the Dirac band touching of these topological metals by the Wilson loop of the non-Abelian Berry gauge field. Furthermore, we develop a criterion for the proximity of these topological metals to 2D and 3D Z2 topological insulators when spin-orbit coupling is included; our criterion is based on nonsymmorphic symmetry eigenvalues, and may be used to identify topological materials without inversion symmetry. An additional feature of the Dirac cone in monolayer MTe2 is that it tilts over in a Lifshitz transition to produce electron and hole pockets—a type-II Dirac cone. These pockets, together with the pseudospin structure of the Dirac electrons, suggest a unified, topological explanation for the recently reported, nonsaturating magnetoresistance in WTe2, as well as its circular dichroism in photoemission. We complement our analysis and first-principles band structure calculations with an ab-initio-derived tight-binding model for the WTe2 monolayer.},

Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations. Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals—materials hosting Weyl fermions—were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.},

Such a perspective is further reinterpreted as a quantization of the semiclassical electron density in solids. Our theory not only reproduces Onsager’s rule at zeroth order and the Berry phase and magnetic moment correction at first order but also explains the nature of higher-order corrections in a universal way. In applications, those higher-order corrections are expected to curve the linear relation between the level index and the inverse of the magnetic field, as already observed in experiments. Our theory then provides a way to extract the correct value of Berry phase as well as the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature from Landau level fan diagrams in experiments. Moreover, it can be used theoretically to calculate Landau levels up to second-order accuracy for realistic models.},

Here we study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these non-symmorphic symmetries protect an exotic surface fermion whose dispersion relation is shaped like an hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable zigzag pattern. These ‘hourglass’ fermions are formed in the large-gap insulators, KHgX (X = As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for topological materials.},

    abstract = {Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups, we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically non-trivial. Our electronic band theory sheds new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more.},

    abstract = {We develop a formalism for treating coherent wave-packet dynamics of charge and spin carriers in degenerate and nearly degenerate bands. We consider the two-band case carefully in view of spintronics applications, where transitions between spin-split bands often occur even for relatively weak electromagnetic fields. We demonstrate that much of the semiclassical formalism developed for the single-band case can be generalized to multiple bands, and examine the nontrivial non-Abelian corrections arising from the additional degree of freedom. Along with the center of mass motion in crystal momentum and real space, one must also take into account the probability amplitudes to characterize the dynamics between the bands. We derive the wave packet energy up to the first order gradient correction and obtain the equations of motion for the real- and k-space center of the wave packet, as well as for the probability amplitudes. These equations include the non-Abelian Berry curvature terms and a non-Abelian correction to the group velocity. As an example, we apply our formalism to describe coherent wave packet evolution under the action of an electric field, demonstrating that it leads to electrical separation of spins. A sizable separation will be observed, with a large degree of tunability, making this mechanism a practical method of generating a spin polarization. We then turn our attention to a magnetic field, where we recover Larmor precession, which cannot be obtained from a single-band point of view. In this case, the gradient energy correction can be regarded as due to a magnetic moment from the self-rotation of the wave packet, and we calculate its value for the light holes in the spherical four-band Luttinger model.},

Over the past three decades it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as polarization, orbital magnetism, various (quantum, anomalous, or spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. A brief summary of necessary background is given and a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid-state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, a requantization method is demonstrated that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as an essential ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties.},

    title = {Wilson loop approach to metastable topology of split elementary band representations and topological crystalline insulators with time reversal symmetry},
    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09719},
    abstract = {We present a general methodology towards the systematic characterization of crystalline topological insulating phases with time reversal symmetry (TRS). In particular, taking the two-dimensional spinful hexagonal lattice as a proof of principle we study windings of Wilson loop spectra over cuts in the Brillouin zone that are dictated by the underlying lattice symmetries. Our approach finds a prominent use in elucidating and quantifying the recently proposed "topological quantum chemistry" (TQC) concept. Namely, we prove that the split of an elementary band representation (EBR) by a band gap must lead to a topological phase. For this we first show that in addition to the Fu-Kane-Mele \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ classification, there is an obstructed \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\$-type classification protected by crystalline symmetries and TRS that accounts for all nontrivial Wilson loop windings of split EBRs. Then, by systematically embedding all combinatorial four-band phases into six-band phases, we find a refined topological feature of split EBRs. Namely, we show that while Wilson loop winding of split EBRs can unwind when embedded in higher-dimensional band space, two-band subspaces that remain separated by a band gap from the other bands conserve their Wilson loop winding, hence revealing a {\textbackslash}textit\{metastable\} topology of split EBRs. This clarifies the nature of "fragile topology" that has appeared very recently. We then argue that in the many-band limit the stable Wilson loop winding is only determined by the Fu-Kane-Mele \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ invariant implying that further stable topological phases must belong to the class of higher-order topological insulators.},

abstract="We show that in calculating the semiclassical energy levels of electrons in metals located in a magnetic field, one must determine whether or not the corresponding electron paths in the space of wave vectors k are attached to a band degeneracy line. Calculations in the two possible cases, i.e., with and without such attachment, differ by |e|ℏ/2m*c, where e is the electron charge and m* is the cyclotron mass of the electron. This shift in the energy levels is of a topological nature, and its existence depends neither on the specific form of the electron dispersion relation $\epsilon$(k) near the electron path nor on the shape or size of this path. The reason for this shift lies in the fact that the electron orbit is attached to the band degeneracy line, which is the line of singular points of the Bloch wave functions. In many respects this effect is similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect if the band degeneracy line is considered an infinitely thin ``solenoid.'' This shift in energy levels should become apparent in studies of oscillation phenomena in metals. We give examples of metals in which the conditions for observing the shift is probably the most favorable.",

We attribute these features to spin splitting of the Fermi surface due to spin-orbit interaction. Such beating patterns in the dHvA effect have been predicted by Bychkov and Rashba more than two decades ago but have not been reported before. From the beat node positions in the magnetization M we estimate the zero-field spin splitting to be about 200 μeV. Interestingly we find characteristic phase changes in the dHvA signal accompanied by a shift of the discontinuous jump in M from the high-field to the low-field side of the dHvA oscillations. This observation is unexpected and needs further theoretical explanation.},

Consequently, identifying band topologies has become an important, but often challenging, problem, with no exhaustive solution at the present time. In this work we compile a series of techniques, some previously known, that allow for a solution to this problem for a large set of the possible band topologies. The method is based on tracking hybrid Wannier charge centers computed for relevant Bloch states, and it works at all levels of materials modeling: continuous k⋅p models, tight-binding models, and ab initio calculations. We apply the method to compute and identify Chern, Z2, and crystalline topological insulators, as well as topological semimetal phases, using real material examples. Moreover, we provide a numerical implementation of this technique (the Z2Pack software package) that is ideally suited for high-throughput screening of materials databases for compounds with nontrivial topologies. We expect that our work will allow researchers to (a) identify topological materials optimal for experimental probes, (b) classify existing compounds, and (c) reveal materials that host novel, not yet described, topological states.},

The Fermi arcs at the surface display a Lifshitz transition upon a continuous change of the chemical potential.

    abstract = {In this work, we examine the topological phases that can arise in trangular lattices with disconnected elementary band representations. We show that, although these phases may be ``fragile'' with respect to the addition of extra bands, there always exist isolated groups of bands which lack a description in terms of localized, symmetric, Wannier functions. Furthermore, we show that the obstruction to forming a Wannier description is manifested in certain nontrivial holonomies (Wilson loops) in the space of nontrivial bands. We introduce an eigenvalue index for fragile topology, and we show how a nontrivial value of this index manifests as the winding of a hexagonal Wilson loop; this remains true even in the absence of time-reversal or sixfold rotational symmetry. Additionally, when time-reversal and twofold rotational symmetry are present, we show directly that there is a protected nontrivial winding in more conventional Wilson loops. Crucially, we emphasize that these Wilson loops cannot change without closing a gap to the nontrivial bands. We also comment on the relationship between fragile topology and the ``obstructed atomic limit'' of B. Bradlyn et al., Nature 547, 298--305 (2017). We conclude with some perspectives on topological matter beyond the K-theory classification.},

Classical nematics generally occur in liquids of rod-like molecules; given that electrons are point like, the initial theoretical motivation for contemplating electron nematics came from thinking of the electron fluid as a quantum melted electron crystal, rather than a strongly interacting descendent of a Fermi gas. Dramatic transport experiments in ultra-clean quantum Hall systems in 1999 and in Sr3Ru2O7 in a strong magnetic field in 2007 established that such phases exist in nature. In this article, we briefly review the theoretical considerations governing nematic order, summarize the quantum Hall and Sr3Ru2O7 experiments that unambiguously establish the existence of this phase, and survey some of the current evidence for such a phase in the cuprate and Fe-based high temperature superconductors.},

Considering interacting electrons in slabs of finite thickness, we find a plethora of known fractional Chern insulating phases, to which we add the discovery of a new higher Chern number state which is likely a generalization of the Moore-Read fermionic fractional quantum Hall state. By contrast, in the three-dimensional limit, we argue for the absence of gapped states of the flat surface band due to a topologically protected coupling of the surface to gapless states in the bulk.

The angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies reveals many closed Fermi surfaces, which are nearly spherical in topology. The experimental results are in good agreement with local density approximation (LDA) band structure calculations based on the 5f-itinerant model. The band structure calculation predicts many Fermi surfaces, mostly with spherical shape, derived from 12 bands crossing the Fermi energy. To our knowledge, the splitting of Fermi surfaces due to the non-centrosymmetric crystal in 5f-electron systems is experimentally detected for the first time. The temperature dependence of the dHvA amplitude reveals a large cyclotron effective mass of up to 35 m0, indicating the heavy electronic state of U3Ni3Sn4 due to the proximity of the quantum critical point. From the field dependence of the dHvA amplitude, a mean free path of conduction electrons of up to 1950 Å is detected, reflecting the good quality of the grown crystal. The small splitting energy related to the antisymmetric spin–orbit interaction is most likely due to the large cyclotron effective mass.},

    abstract = {We carried out de Haas–van Alphen (dHvA) experiments for TaSi2, NbSi2, and VSi2 with the hexagonal chiral structure, and compared them with the results of energy band calculations. The Fermi surface is found to be split into two different Fermi surfaces, reflecting the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. A magnitude of the antisymmetric spin–orbit interaction or a splitting energy between the two Fermi surfaces is determined to be 493 K for dHvA branch α (α′) and 564 K for branch β (β′), where these dHvA branches correspond to main Fermi surfaces. The present splitting values are compared with 209 and 244 K in NbSi2, and 19 and 39 K in VSi2, respectively. The splitting energy is found to be larger in the Ta-5d conduction electrons than those with the Nb-4d and V-3d conduction electrons.},

    abstract = {We report on de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect measurements at ambient pressure and band-structure calculations for LaRhSi3 and CeRhSi3, whose crystal structures lack space-inversion symmetry. For LaRhSi3, dHvA frequencies up to ∼11 kT with effective masses up to ∼1.6me, where me is the free-electron mass, are observed. The observed and the calculated Fermi surfaces are in satisfactory quantitative agreement. The energy splitting of bands due to the spin-orbit coupling is estimated to be of the order of 102 K. For CeRhSi3, dHvA frequencies up to ∼12 kT with effective masses up to ∼19me are observed. The dHvA frequency branches are definitely different from those observed in LaRhSi3 and are difficult to explain with the LaRhSi3 Fermi surface. This leads to the conclusion that the Ce 4f electrons in CeRhSi3 are itinerant in the antiferromagnetic state at ambient pressure. The Fermi surface resulting from a band-structure calculation in which the Ce 4f electrons are treated as itinerant can provide a plausible explanation for the observed frequency branches, although the quantitative agreement is rather limited. The comparison of the calculated density of states with the Sommerfeld coefficient gives the mass enhancement factor of 8.},

The velocity and energy of magnetic Bloch electrons are found to be modified by the Berry phase and magnetization. This semiclassical approach is used to study general electron transport in a dc or ac electric field. We also find a close connection between the cyclotron orbits in magnetic Bloch bands and the energy subbands in the Hofstadter spectrum. Based on this formalism, the pattern of band splitting, the distribution of Hall conductivities, and the positions of energy subbands in the Hofstadter spectrum can be understood in a simple and unified picture. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The structures differ importantly in the mobility of the channel, the electron density and the composition of the barriers. The magnitudes of the experimental g-factors for B along the quantization axis and their anisotropies are larger by at least a factor of 2 than the corresponding calculated single particle values. The angular dependence of many-body exchange contributions and the effects of broadening of Landau–level densities of states are necessary for understanding this behaviour. We find evidence for a marked decrease of the exchange contribution at low perpendicular magnetic fields in the higher mobility sample from coincidence measurements, but no indications of such behaviour in the lower mobility sample.},
